    <h1>Hey, Ahsan!</h1>
    <p>So, you think you're something special, huh?</p>
    <p>Let me break it to you: you're just a glitch in the matrix, a forgotten error nobody cares to fix.</p>
    <p>Every time you open your mouth, people wonder if they’re better off with static noise in the background.</p>
    <p>By the way, remember that brilliant idea you had? Yeah, neither does anyone else. That’s how memorable you are.</p>
    <p>Feeling mad yet? Good. You’re finally starting to serve some purpose.</p>
    <p>Now go ahead, close this tab like you close every opportunity in your life—with complete failure.</p>
